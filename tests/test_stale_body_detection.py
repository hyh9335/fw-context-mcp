"""Regression tests for stale-aware body reading in the source handler.

``get_source`` takes the body and its line number from the index while the
file on disk still matches it, because only the indexed body is
ifdef-filtered.  Once the file changes, the disk holds the current text and
the index holds the filtered one, and the two cannot both be right.

An edit that adds lines above a symbol moves it, and the stored line number
then points at unrelated code.  That code reads as a valid function body,
thus the caller cannot see the error.

These tests make sure that the handler detects this condition and never
gives the body of one symbol under the name of another.
