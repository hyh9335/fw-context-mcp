"""Line ranges that the preprocessor skipped, from the record of libclang.

WHY this module exists: the index must show only the code that compiles for
the active build.  Two earlier sources of that answer both let dead code
through, because each one only guessed at it:

1. ``tu.cursor.get_tokens()`` — ``clang_tokenize`` is a raw lexer over a
   range of characters.  It does not do preprocessing, thus it gives tokens
   for an inactive ``#if`` branch also.
2. The extent of a cursor — an extent is one continuous range of lines.  A
   dead block inside the body of a function is inside the extent of that
   function, thus the extent keeps it.

``clang_getAllSkippedRanges`` is not a guess.  It is the record that the
preprocessor itself made of the ranges it skipped.  The assembly path
(``asm.py``) already takes its active lines from the output of the
preprocessor.  This module gives the C path the same class of answer.

The python bindings of libclang do not give this function, thus the module
binds it with ``ctypes``.  ``clang_getAllSkippedRanges`` is in libclang from
version 5.0, and the project needs libclang 18.1.1 or later, thus the
function is always available.  The code degrades to an empty answer all the
same, because a build of libclang that cannot answer must not stop an index
run.  Three failures give that empty answer: the symbol is absent, the call
raises, and the structure of the answer does not match the layout.  An index
run of a large project takes hours, thus an unfiltered body is a far smaller
loss than a run that stops.

    The ``CXSourceRangeList`` structure is local to this function because it
    needs the ``SourceRange`` of the python bindings as its element type, and
    the bindings load lazily — every other module of the indexer imports
    ``clang.cindex`` inside a function for the same reason.  A local copy of
    the layout of ``CXSourceRange`` would go stale against the bindings.

    WHY a cache: the binding writes ``argtypes`` and ``restype`` on the

            that option the preprocessor keeps no record, and libclang gives
            zero ranges — a silent answer of "no dead code" for every file.

    Returns:
        A map from the resolved path of a file to the set of its dead
        lines.  A file with no dead line is not in the map.

        A line is dead only when EVERY read of its file skipped it.  One
        file can enter one unit more than one time, and a read that comes
        after the first one skips the whole block of an include guard.  The
        first read compiled that block, thus the block is live code.

        The path is resolved because libclang spells one file more than one
        way — ``./inc/api.h`` at the point of the ``#include`` and an
        absolute path in the extent of a cursor.  A caller must resolve its
        own path also, or the two never agree.

        An empty map is the correct answer for a translation unit that has
        no inactive branch.  It is also what a libclang without these
        symbols gives, thus a caller cannot tell the two apart — and does
        not need to, because both mean "blank out no line".

    A range covers the directive lines at its two ends: it starts on the
    ``#if`` (or ``#elif`` / ``#else``) line and ends on the line of the
    directive that closes the branch.  A conditional directive is always
    alone on its line, thus a caller can blank out every line of the range
    and lose no live code.
